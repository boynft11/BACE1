# BACE Three Devtool

## Credits to the previous Three Devtool (@jsantell), https://github.com/threejs/three-devtools, and @rafaelsc for the browser-polyfill upgrade to make this extension Chrome compatible

## Changes from the previous Three Devtool
- removed requirement to hit reload button when extension is first opened
- implemented search bar functionality to allow users to search through entities by uuid, name or type
- updated three.js version to the latest version
- added a feature to save a desired position/rotation/scale variables when working in transform and console it when needed
- A new hide/show feature next to all elements

## Tool set-up 
- To start accessing the tool, download the chrome extension on to your chrome browser
- The tool sometimes has trouble working with iframes, so it's best to work with three.js graphics on an html page
- Open the dev-tool through the top panel and click on the BACE-three-devtools.  The tool should automatically load
